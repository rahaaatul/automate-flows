### Notes

1. The `SEARCH_ENGINE_LIST` variable is a dictionary containing site shortcuts.
2. Each key ends with a space. Why? Because of **_Auto Suggestions_**.
   - When you type `@`, Quickie will display suggestions that can be auto filled when selected.
   - Selecting a suggestion automatically adds an extra space after it, thanks to the hacky solution we structured with the dictionary keys.
   - This is a workaround to ensure smooth autofill functionality. Currently, there‚Äôs no better solution‚Äî_feel free to correct me if I'm wrong._

## Process Data

```json
{
  "custom-engine": "contains(INPUT, \"@* \")",
  "search-engine": "findAll(INPUT, \"(@\\w+)\")[1]",
  "search-query": "replaceAll(INPUT, \"(@\\w+)\\s+\")"
}
```

### Notes

- This dictionary is where üîç**_Quickie_** processes input and stores the results in the `PROCESSED_DATA` variable.
  - `custom-engine`:
    - Checks if the user is using a shortcut by detecting an `@` symbol in the input.
    - Stores a boolean value: 0 (`false`) or 1 (`true`).
    - Determines if a shortcut or the default search engine should be used.
  - `search-engine`:
    - Identifies which shortcut (e.g., `@google`, `@bing`) is being used.
    - Stores the value of the detected shortcut key.
  - `search-query`:
    - Strips the shortcut key from the input.
    - Makes the search query ready for use with the selected search engine.

---

## Usage

```shell
PROCESSED_DATA["custom-engine"] == 1 ?

SEARCH_ENGINE_LIST[PROCESSED_DATA["search-engine"]] ++ PROCESSED_DATA["search-query"] :

SEARCH_ENGINE_LIST["@google"] ++ PROCESSED_DATA["search-query"]
```

### Notes

1. This is where the core logic is applied.
2. `PROCESSED_DATA["custom-engine"] == 1`
   - Determines if Quickie should use custom search engines.
3. If it's True:

   ```shell
   SEARCH_ENGINE_LIST[PROCESSED_DATA["search-engine"]] ++ PROCESSED_DATA["search-query"]
   ```

   - Retrieves the shortcut URL for the selected search engine (e.g., `https://www.bing.com/search?q=`).
   - Appends the cleaned search query from `PROCESSED_DATA["search-query"]` (e.g., `i'm searching on bing`).
   - The result combines the shortcut and query like this: `https://www.bing.com/search?q=i'm+searching+on+bing`.

4. If it's False:

   ```shell
   SEARCH_ENGINE_LIST["@google"] ++ PROCESSED_DATA["search-query"]
   ```

   - Uses the default search engine URL (e.g., `https://www.google.com/search?q=`).
   - Appends the search query from `PROCESSED_DATA["search-query"]` (e.g., `this is my default search engine`).
   - The result combines the default URL and query like this: `https://www.google.com/search?q=this+is+my+default+search+engine`.
